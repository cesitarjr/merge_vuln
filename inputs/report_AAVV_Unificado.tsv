Externo	alphabet-pre.e-mailteck.com	Baja	Baja	Content Security Policy Missing 'Report-To'	Content Security Policy (CSP) is a web security standard that helps to mitigate attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking or mixed content issues. CSP provides mechanisms to websites to restrict content that browsers will be allowed to load.The 'report-to' directive allows websites to specify a reporting endpoint where browsers can send CSP violation reports. This helps administrators monitor policy violations and fine-tune their security policies.While a Content Security Policy has been detected on this host, it is missing the 'report-to' directive, which means potential violations won't be reported automatically. This reduces visibility into security events that could help identify and remediate issues.	Add the 'report-to' directive to your existing Content Security Policy header.	Pendiente	14/01/2026		On page 'https://alphabet-pre.e-mailteck.com/' the Content-Security-Policy header has no 'report-to' directive.	Sistemas	NO	18/07/2025	1
Externo	alphabet-pre.e-mailteck.com	Baja	Baja	Cookie Without SameSite Flag Detected	SameSite is an attribute which can be set on a cookie to instruct the web browser if this cookie can be sent along with cross-site requests to help prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.The attribute has three possible values :- Strict : the cookie will only be sent in a first-party context, thus preventing cross-site requests initiated from third-party websites to include it.- Lax : the cookie is allowed to be sent in GET cross-site requests initiated by the top-level navigation from third-party websites. For example, following an hypertext link from the external website will make the request include the cookie.- None : the cookie is explicitly set to be sent by the browser in any context.The scanner identified the lack of SameSite attribute on cookies set by the application or a misconfiguration.	Web browsers default behavior may differ when processing cookies in a cross-site context, making the final decision to send the cookie in this context unpredictable. The SameSite attribute should be set in every cookie to enforce the expected result by developers. When using the 'None' attribute value, ensure that the cookie is also set with the 'Secure' flag.	Pendiente	14/01/2026		The scanner detected a cookie named 'XSRF-TOKEN' set through a 'Set-Cookie' header which does not have the 'SameSite' attribute set.	Sistemas	NO	18/07/2025	1
Externo	alphabet-pre.e-mailteck.com	Baja	Baja	Cookie Without Secure Flag Detected	When the `secure` flag is set on a cookie, the browser will prevent it from being sent over a clear text channel (HTTP) and only allow it to be sent when an encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).The scanner discovered that a cookie was set by the server without the secure flag being set. Although the initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS connection, any HTTP link to the same server will result in the cookie being sent in clear text.Note that if the cookie does not contain sensitive information, the risk of this vulnerability is mitigated.	If the cookie contains sensitive information, then the server should ensure that the cookie has the `secure` flag set.	Pendiente	14/01/2026		The scanner detected a cookie named 'laravel_session' set through a 'Set-Cookie' header without the Secure flag set.	Sistemas	NO	18/07/2025	1

Externo	alphabet-pre.e-mailteck.com	Baja	Baja	Permissive Content Security Policy Detected	Content Security Policy (CSP) is a web security standard that helps to mitigate attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking or mixed content issues. CSP provides mechanisms to websites to restrict content that browsers will be allowed to load.One or several permissive directives have been detected. See output for more details.	Content Security Policies are designed to have control over where resources on a website can be loaded from. Implementing a policy depends on the application type (web applications, APIs...) and the directives have to be specified according to this.For web applications, The following directive configurations can usually be applied to restrict the policy:- 'frame-ancestors' should be set to 'none' to avoid rendering of page in <frame>, <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, or <applet>.- 'form-action' should be explicitly set to 'self' to restrict form submission to the origin which the protected page is being served.- Any of the 'unsafe-*' directives indicate that the action is considered unsafe and it is better to refactor the code to avoid using HTML event handlers that rely on this.- data: https: http: URI in 'default-src', 'object-src', 'base-uri' & 'script-src' allow execution of unsafe scripts and should not be set.- * and *.* in 'script-src' and other '-src' directives allows execution of unsafe scripts and should be restricted.- 'default-src' should be explicitly set to 'self' or 'none' and individual directives required for each source type set more permissively as required- * and *.* in 'default-src' allows various unconfigured parameters to default to a unsafe configuration and then should not be set.For APIs, there should not be any need to load resources like scripts or frames, so specifying a strict policy using default-src 'none' and frame-ancestors 'none' is recommended.If some unsafe directives are required for business continuity in your environment, apply mitigating controls suitable for your environment and work with the vendors of the products for which these directives are required. Note that different CSP versions exist, and that some of the directives may not work depending on the browser versions used when accessing the web application.	Pendiente	14/01/2026		"The scanner detected the following permissive statements in the detected effective Content Security Policy :
The 'script-src' directive has the following issue(s) :
- The directive uses a permissive keyword which allows unsafe script execution : 'unsafe-inline'.
- The directive uses a permissive keyword which allows unsafe script execution : 'unsafe-eval'.
The 'style-src' directive has the following issue(s) :
- The directive is missing."	Sistemas	NO	18/07/2025	1
Externo	alphabet-pre.e-mailteck.com	Informativa	Informativa	Allowed HTTP Methods	There are a number of HTTP methods that can be used on a webserver (`OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc.). Each of these methods perform a different function and each have an associated level of risk when their use is permitted on the webserver.By sending an HTTP OPTIONS request and a direct HTTP request for each method, the scanner discovered the methods that are allowed by the server.	It is recommended that a whitelisting approach be taken to explicitly permit only the HTTP methods required by the application and block all others.
